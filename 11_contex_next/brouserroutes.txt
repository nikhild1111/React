Why Use <BrowserRouter> in React?
<BrowserRouter> is a component provided by React Router that enables client-side routing in a React application. It allows navigation without reloading the page, making the app feel smoother and faster.

Key Reasons to Use <BrowserRouter>
1. Enables Single Page Application (SPA) Navigation
In a traditional website, navigating between pages reloads the entire page.

With <BrowserRouter>, React handles route changes without a full page reload.

2. Uses Clean URLs (History API)
Unlike HashRouter, which uses # in the URL (example.com/#/home), <BrowserRouter> uses clean, readable URLs like example.com/home.

3. Provides Routing Context
It wraps the entire application and provides access to useLocation, useParams, and useSearchParams hooks.

4. Supports Dynamic Routing
Helps create dynamic routes based on parameters (/user/:id).

5. Works Well with Components like <Routes> and <Route>
Defines how different URLs render different components.
